# Contributing

All I ask is that you put contributions into the contributions branch, in most cases I will use them in one way or another in the master/publications branch.
**Please do not delete anything withing this branch**, for further help contact me at (rnelson009@stpaul.k12.mn.us)[rnelson009@stpaul.k12.mn.us]. Please note that that is my school email address and I will be changing it soon.
